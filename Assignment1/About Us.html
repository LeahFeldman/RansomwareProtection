            <details>Ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system or data, typically by
                encrypting it, until a sum of money is paid. Over the past decade, ransomware attacks have become increasingly 
                frequent and sophisticated, posing a significant threat to organizations of all sizes and even individuals.
